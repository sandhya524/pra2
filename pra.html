The filmmaker also celebrated his 90th birthday earlier this month when he revealed that he was working on 2-3 projects. <br>“We all grow old. I don’t do anything great (on my birthday). It may be a special day, but I don’t celebrate it specifically. I cut a cake at the office with my team," he told PTI and then added, “I’m working on two to three projects; they are all different from one another. <br>It’s difficult to say which one I will make. They are all for the big screen."<!--here we use bold,break,pre,hr-->
